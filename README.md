# Network Analysis
Network Analysis is a Python program that helps users capture and display network packages in highly visualizing graphs. The graphs will not only allow users to acknowledge the relationship between network devices in a network, but they also support users in pinpointing the abnormalities in the network via numerous details that are displayed for each node in the graph.
