# Network Analysis
Network Analysis is a Python program that helps users capture and display network packages in highly visualizing graphs. The graphs will not only allow users to acknowledge the relationship between network devices in a network, but they also support users in pinpointing the abnormalities in the network via numerous details that are displayed for each node in the graph. For example, the graphs can help user monitor who is connecting to their machine, what is the shortest path from this node to other nodes,....</br>
